In the case of non-observance of this clause, the User is exposed to the offence of counterfeit, liable to penal sanctions as well as civil ones, which sanction the violation of any of the rights of exploitation of the holder for software (article L.122-6 of the “Code de la Propriété Intellectuelle).
